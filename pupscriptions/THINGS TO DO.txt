THINGS TO DO

1. Once the user inputs the dog's name, replace the field with dog's name
2. Make the button for meds appear only after dogs name has been entered.

Thinking through the button...
inputComplete true/false. If inputComplete is false, then the field is visible. If inputComplete is true (changes upon user pressing enter), then field is hidden.

^^^ start here first before then disaplaying button.
